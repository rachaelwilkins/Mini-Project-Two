# Mini-Project-Two

Welcome to my second Mini Project, as part of my certificate in Software Engineering!

For this project, I am developing (and testing, oh boy) my React skills to build an app for a World Clock. Users can type in a city, and get the exact time and date in an instant.

Nothing too flashy as we don't have much time to work on this, but (hopefully) effective nonetheless.
